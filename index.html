Since each block contains information about the previous block, they effectively form a chain (compare <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list">linked list</a> data structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.

                Blockchains are typically managed by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer">peer-to-peer (P2P)</a> computer network for use as a public <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_ledger">distributed ledger</a>, where nodes collectively adhere to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_algorithm">consensus algorithm</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol">protocol</a> to add and validate new transaction blocks. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(blockchain)">blockchain forks</a> are possible, blockchains may be considered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_by_design">secure by design</a> and exemplify a distributed computing system with high <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance">Byzantine fault tolerance</a>.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>

                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography">Cryptographer</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Chaum">David Chaum</a> first proposed a blockchain-like protocol in his 1982 dissertation "Computer Systems Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups".<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> Further work on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Haber">Stuart Haber</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Scott_Stornetta">W.

In 1992, Haber, Stornetta, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Bayer">Dave Bayer</a> incorporated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">Merkle trees</a> into the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be collected into one block.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-cryptocurrencytech-4">[4]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> Under their company Surety, their document certificate hashes have been published in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times">The New York Times</a> every week since 1995.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-:0-13">[13]</a></sup>

                The first decentralized blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto">Satoshi Nakamoto</a> in 2008. Nakamoto improved the design in an important way using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashcash">Hashcash</a>-like method to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timestamp-based_concurrency_control">timestamp</a> blocks without requiring them to be signed by a trusted party and introducing a difficulty parameter to stabilize the rate at which blocks are added to the chain.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-cryptocurrencytech-4">[4]</a></sup> The design was implemented the following year by Nakamoto as a core component of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency">cryptocurrency</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin">bitcoin</a>, where it serves as the public ledger for all transactions on the network.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-te20151031-3">[3]</a></sup>

                In August 2014, the bitcoin blockchain file size, containing records of all transactions that have occurred on the network, reached 20 GB (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte">gigabytes</a>).<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> In January 2015, the size had grown to almost 30 GB, and from January 2016 to January 2017, the bitcoin blockchain grew from 50 GB to 100 GB in size. The ledger size had exceeded 200 GB by early 2020.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup>

                Sometimes separate blocks can be produced concurrently, creating a temporary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(blockchain)">fork</a>. In addition to a secure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash-based_cryptography">hash-based</a> history, any blockchain has a specified algorithm for scoring different versions of the history so that one with a higher score can be selected over others. Blocks not selected for inclusion in the chain are called orphan blocks.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-hadc-27">[27]</a></sup> Peers supporting the database have different versions of the history from time to time. They keep only the highest-scoring version of the database known to them. Whenever a peer receives a higher-scoring version (usually the old version with a single new block added) they extend or overwrite their own database and retransmit the improvement to their peers. There is never an absolute guarantee that any particular entry will remain in the best version of history forever. Blockchains are typically built to add the score of new blocks onto old blocks and are given incentives to extend with new blocks rather than overwrite old blocks. Therefore, the probability of an entry becoming superseded decreases exponentially<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-bsm-29">[29]</a></sup> as more blocks are built on top of it, eventually becoming very low.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-te20151031-3">[3]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-t12-30">[30]</a>:ch. 08<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-paper-31">[31]</a></sup> For example, bitcoin uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system">proof-of-work system</a>, where the chain with the most cumulative proof-of-work is considered the valid one by the network.

                This section is an excerpt from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(blockchain)#Hard_fork">Fork (blockchain) § Hard fork</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                A hard fork is a change to the blockchain protocol that is not backward compatible and requires all users to upgrade their software in order to continue participating in the network. In a hard fork, the network splits into two separate versions: one that follows the new rules and one that follows the old rules.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, Ethereum was hard forked in 2016 to "make whole" the investors in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)">The DAO</a>, which had been hacked by exploiting a vulnerability in its code. In this case, the fork resulted in a split creating Ethereum and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum_Classic">Ethereum Classic</a> chains. In 2014 the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nxt>">Nxt</a> community was asked to consider a hard fork that would have led to a rollback of the blockchain records to mitigate the effects of a theft of 50 million NXT from a major <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_exchange">cryptocurrency exchange</a>. The hard fork proposal was rejected, and some of the funds were recovered after negotiations and ransom payment. Alternatively, to prevent a permanent split, a majority of nodes using the new software may return to the old rules, as was the case of bitcoin split on 12 March 2013.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-Fork_(blockchain)_ArsFork-34">[34]</a></sup>
            </p>
            <p>
                A more recent hard-fork example is of Bitcoin in 2017, which resulted in a split creating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_Cash">Bitcoin Cash</a>.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-Fork_(blockchain)_bpr-35">[35]</a></sup> The network split was mainly due to a disagreement in how to increase the transactions per second to accommodate for demand.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-Fork_(blockchain)_CNN_2017-08-01-36">[36]</a></sup>

                By storing data across its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer">peer-to-peer network</a>, the blockchain eliminates some risks that come with data being held centrally.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-te20151031-3">[3]</a></sup> The decentralized blockchain may use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hoc">ad hoc</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_passing">message passing</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_networking">distributed networking</a>.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup>

Value tokens sent across the network are recorded as belonging to that address. A private key is like a password that gives its owner access to their digital assets or the means to otherwise interact with the various capabilities that blockchains now support. Data stored on the blockchain is generally considered incorruptible.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-te20151031-3">[3]</a></sup>

            <p>
                Finality is the level of confidence that the well-formed block recently appended to the blockchain will not be revoked in the future (is "finalized") and thus can be trusted. Most distributed blockchain protocols, whether <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work">proof of work</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake">proof of stake</a>, cannot guarantee the finality of a freshly committed block, and instead rely on "probabilistic finality": as the block goes deeper into a blockchain, it is less likely to be altered or reverted by a newly found consensus.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-Deirmentzoglou_et_al-43">[43]</a></sup>

            <p>
                Currently, there are at least four types of blockchain networks — public blockchains, private blockchains, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consortium">consortium</a> blockchains and hybrid blockchains.

            <h3 id="public-blockchains">Public blockchains</h3>

                A public blockchain has absolutely no access restrictions. Anyone with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">Internet</a> connection can send <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_transaction">transactions</a> to it as well as become a validator (i.e., participate in the execution of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_(computer_science)">consensus protocol</a>).<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-71">[71]</a></sup><sup>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Self-published_sources">self-published source?</a>]</sup> Usually, such networks offer economic incentives for those who secure them and utilize some type of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-stake">proof-of-stake</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work">proof-of-work</a> algorithm.
            </p>
            <h3 id="private-blockchains">Private blockchains</h3>
            <p>
                A private blockchain is permissioned.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-btit-53">[53]</a></sup> One cannot join it unless invited by the network administrators. Participant and validator access is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_platform">restricted</a>. To distinguish between open blockchains and other peer-to-peer decentralized database applications that are not open ad-hoc compute clusters, the terminology <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Ledger">Distributed Ledger</a> (DLT) is normally used for private blockchains.

            <h3 id="hybrid-blockchains">Hybrid blockchains</h3>
            <p>
                A hybrid blockchain has a combination of centralized and decentralized features.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-72">[72]</a></sup> The exact workings of the chain can vary based on which portions of centralization and decentralization are used.

                A sidechain is a designation for a blockchain ledger that runs in parallel to a primary blockchain.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-73">[73]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-74">[74]</a></sup> Entries from the primary blockchain (where said entries typically represent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_asset">digital assets</a>) can be linked to and from the sidechain; this allows the sidechain to otherwise operate independently of the primary blockchain (e.g., by using an alternate means of record keeping, alternate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_(computer_science)">consensus algorithm</a>, etc.).<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-75">[75]</a>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS">better source needed</a>]</sup>
            </p>
            <h3 id="consortium-blockchain">Consortium blockchain</h3>
            <p>
                A consortium blockchain is a type of blockchain that combines elements of both public and private blockchains. In a consortium blockchain, a group of organizations come together to create and operate the blockchain, rather than a single entity. The consortium members jointly manage the blockchain network and are responsible for validating transactions. Consortium blockchains are permissioned, meaning that only certain individuals or organizations are allowed to participate in the network. This allows for greater control over who can access the blockchain and helps to ensure that sensitive information is kept confidential.
            </p>
            <p>
                Consortium blockchains are commonly used in industries where multiple organizations need to collaborate on a common goal, such as supply chain management or financial services. One advantage of consortium blockchains is that they can be more efficient and scalable than public blockchains, as the number of nodes required to validate transactions is typically smaller. Additionally, consortium blockchains can provide greater security and reliability than private blockchains, as the consortium members work together to maintain the network. Some examples of consortium blockchains include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quorum">Quorum</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperledger">Hyperledger</a>.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-76">[76]</a></sup>

                With the increasing number of blockchain systems appearing, even only those that support cryptocurrencies, blockchain interoperability is becoming a topic of major importance. The objective is to support transferring assets from one blockchain system to another blockchain system. Wegner<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-wegner-150">[150]</a></sup> stated that "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interoperability">interoperability</a>" is the ability of two or more software components to cooperate despite differences in language, interface, and execution platform". The objective of blockchain interoperability is therefore to support such cooperation among blockchain systems, despite those kinds of differences.

            <p>
                There are already several blockchain interoperability solutions available.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-survey-151">[151]</a></sup> They can be classified into three categories: cryptocurrency interoperability approaches, blockchain engines, and blockchain connectors.

            <p>
                Some cryptocurrencies use blockchain mining — the peer-to-peer computer computations by which transactions are validated and verified. This requires a large amount of energy. In June 2018, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_for_International_Settlements">Bank for International Settlements</a> criticized the use of public <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work">proof-of-work</a> blockchains for their high energy consumption.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-153">[153]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-154">[154]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-155">[155]</a></sup>
